business,"The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said.The figure for the third quarter is in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September.It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%.Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months.The ONS also issued a separate monthly figure for September, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth.Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.Simon Jack, business editorThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.  Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.""ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.""Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters."""
business,"Bombardier workers face uncertainty after the Canadian aerospace giant announced 5,000 job cuts around the world.The struggling plane and train manufacturer said more than half of the cuts, to be made over the next 12-18 months, would be made in Canada.The company said the job cuts would be made to ""streamline"" operations as part of a broader restructuring plan. Bombardier employs 70,000 people worldwide. The Montreal-based company has production and engineering sites in 28 countries. The company estimates the job cuts - about 7% of the global workforce - will save $250m (Â£190m). The cuts will come mostly from its aerospace division with some from the firm's rail division. Bombardier says that 2,500 workers will be cut in the Canadian province of Quebec and 500 workers from the province of Ontario. A spokesman said the firm does not yet have details on the remaining expected job losses. The announcement came as Bombardier unveiled its third-quarter results, in which pre-tax profits doubled to $267m for the three months to September compared with the same period last year.Sales were down 5% to $3.6bn, but revenue is expected to jump 10% to at least $18bn next year.The firm will also sell two of its ""non-core"" businesses, its Q Series aircraft for $900m and the de Havilland trademark,  for $300m.""We continue to make solid progress executing our turnaround plan,"" said chief executive Alain Bellemare in a statement. ""We have set in motion the next round of actions necessary to unleash the full potential of the Bombardier portfolio."" Earlier this year, Bombardier sold a majority stake in its loss-making C-Series aircraft to Europe's Airbus, with the plane being renamed the A220.Mr Bellemare was brought in three years ago to shore up Bombardier, which was facing serious financial trouble with the C Series programme and had to be rescued by the Quebec government with a $1bn bailout."
business,"The Bank of England is testing the UK's ability to withstand a major cyber-attack on financial institutions. Some 40 firms, including leading banks, are taking part in a one-day ""war-gaming"" exercise designed to assess their resilience.The Bank is conducting the exercise on Friday in partnership with regulators and the Treasury.It wants to ensure that firms are able to meet certain minimum recovery standards after a cyber-attack.""The exercise will help authorities and firms identify improvements to our collective response arrangements, improving the resilience of the sector as a whole,"" the Bank said.The Bank has expressed fears that disruption to one bank's payments could have a direct impact on the economy, by preventing its customers from paying for goods and services. It could also cause a ripple effect which would spread to other banks.Robert Schifreen, a former hacker turned cyber-security expert, told the BBC's Today programme that the exercise was welcome but unrealistic.""It's going to be a nice Friday, everyone's cleared their diary, everyone knows what's going to happen, and it doesn't normally happen like this,"" he said.""When you get hacked, it's probably going to be on a Sunday afternoon, half the people you need to contact are going to be away on holiday and haven't told you what their contact numbers are, so it's not realistic, but it's great to see them doing something."""
business,"Thanks to President Trump there may be choppy waters ahead for Greece's vital shipping industry.As the US this week reinstated a global ban on Iranian oil exports, there are few countries outside of Iran that will be more affected by the move than Greece.This is because Greece's merchant shipping fleet - the biggest in the world by tonnage - is also the largest transporter of Iranian oil.Of the 217 oil tankers that ferried Iranian crude oil in the first six months of this year, 81, or 37%, were Greek-owned. The next highest was Iran's own National Iranian Tanker Company with 51 ships, followed by Denmark, China and Japan.Although Greece is one of eight countries to be given a 180-day extension by the US - with the others being China, India, Italy, Japan, Turkey, South Korea and Taiwan -  the White House has told those nations to start reducing their Iranian oil orders.And with every other country told to stop immediately, or else face their own knock-on trade penalties from the US, Greece's oil tankers may be about to see a substantial drop in business.Dimitrios Lyridis, associate professor of maritime transport at the National Technical University of Athens, says that most Greek shipping companies will comply with the ban, because the US is also targeting individual firms doing business with Iran.As a result, continuing to ship Iranian oil could see Greek firms banned from doing business in the US and from using American ports.""[Most] Greek shipping companies will comply with Trump's order,"" says Mr Lyridis.""Many of these companies are on the US stock market, so the risk of non-compliance is just too high.""I see them diversifying towards other markets, for instance, the Saudi one, currently under pressure to increase its oil output.""George Vaggelas, researcher and consultant on port economics, management and policy issues, at the University of the Aegean on the Greek island of Chios, agrees that Greek shipping firms listed in the US - such as Navios Maritime Holdings and Tsakos Energy Navigation - will comply.However, Mr Vaggelas thinks that some Greek shipping firms without links to the US financial markets may continue to ship Iranian oil.""These - though few - might continue serving Iranian oil exports at an increased risk,"" he says.The shipping firms themselves are unwilling to comment given the seriousness of the situation, and none of those we contacted were prepared to give us a statement. The main Greek shipping trade unions also declined to provide a quote.Mr Vaggelas is hopeful though that in practice the US will offer numerous countries - not just the eight given an extension - wiggle room.He sees France and other European Union countries applying the oil embargo in a ""laxer way"" than the US, both to secure supplies, and because they want to keep the 2015 agreement on Iran's nuclear programme alive.It was President Trump's decision to rip up this deal, negotiated by the administration of predecessor President Obama, that paved the way for the reinstatement of the embargo on Iranian oil exports.President Trump has called the 2015 agreement the ""worst deal ever negotiated"".His administration also says it wants to stop what it calls Iran's ""malign"" activities, including support for terror groups in the Middle East, and ballistic missile tests.The US hopes that the sanctions will force Iran back to the negotiating table.Yet despite Mr Vaggelas' optimism that European nations will continue to source Iranian oil, he does not dispute that the number of Greek-owned tankers involved in Iranian exports will dwindle.Other commentators are more confident about the future for Greece's oil tankers.Some, such as Court Smith, trade analyst at UK-based Vessels Value, which tracks the global shipping industry, thinks that the Iranian ban may actually give Greek shipping firms a boost.His argument is that countries will need to source the oil they used to get from Iran from elsewhere, which may be further away, and therefore give more profits to the owners of the oil tankers because their ships will be spending much longer at sea.""A good example of this is India, which is very close to Iran,"" says Mr Court.""It will [probably] be purchasing more crude oil from other sources, which are further away [such as countries in West Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean].""When the dust settles, however, it remains to be seen how long the embargo against Iran - the world's sixth largest oil exporter - will remain in place.Prof Lyridis says this is dependent upon global oil prices, and whether the price rises significantly as a result of Iranian exports being curtailed.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""With Iran being a huge crude oil exporter, maintaining the penalty might prove unsustainable because global oil prices will [potentially] skyrocket,"" he says.Prof Lyridis adds that this, coupled with President Trump's unpredictability, could mean the embargo is relatively short-lived.The Greek government declined to comment."
business,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to James Hind, founder of UK car price comparison website Carwow.While unforeseen circumstances can completely change all our lives, it was the global financial crisis that sent James Hind down an entirely different path.In 2008 he was a 21-year-old intern working at a UK investment fund when the world of finance was hit by turmoil.""I watched the industry collapse, it was just chaos,"" he says.""I suddenly realised that people in the financial world didn't have any control, they were just riding a wave. Watching that I realised it wasn't for me.""So having previously planned to have a long career in finance, James walked away.Not immediately knowing what else to do with his life, he remembered that he had once been given the job advice that you should ""do what you love"".As a big fan of cars, he decided to launch a website that collated car reviews, and then try to sell advertising on the pages.Today the business is London-based price comparison website Carwow, and in 2017 it had an annual turnover of Â£15m.Not bad for a company that the Nottingham University graduate started in the loft of his parents' home on the Wirral Peninsula in the north west of England, and one that initially found it impossible to secure any funding.After first going travelling for a year, James launched the initial iteration of Carwow in 2010, when it was called Carbuzz.With his girlfriend Alexandra Margolis on board as co-founder, she designed the website while he set about adding all the content.Over the next few years advertising revenues trickled in, before James realised that the operation could both be more useful to customers, and far more lucrative, if it changed its business model.So he reinvented the website into one where users could search for the best price for a new car.Mirroring the price comparison websites that have particularly changed the insurance industry, his idea was that people could enter the exact details of the make and model of car they wanted, not just the colour and engine-size, but the precise combination of optional extras.A list of prices offered by dealers across the UK would then be displayed on the screen. ""I realised that many people hated buying a car, they went into it expecting to have a bad time,"" says James, now 31.""And a big reason for this was because most of us hate haggling, and buying a new car has always been a very rare example of a time when you were expected to have to do this.""My idea was to completely remove the need for people to haggle.""More The Boss features:Bringing a technology savvy friend called David Santoro on board to build the new website, the new version of the company was launched in 2012.But while a number of car dealers across the UK were happy to give it a go, potential investors most certainly were not.""In the early days we massively struggled to secure funding,"" says James.""We contacted virtually every venture capital fund in London, and all either said no, or just ignored us.""And I can understand why. We were young entrepreneurs with no track record, and we had very little proof at the time that the business was going to work.""It took a year and a half of ""cold emailing"" potential investors before the company got its first investment.The name change from Carbuzz to Carwow happened in 2014 because, ambitious for global growth in the future, James discovered that the Carbuzz brand had already been taken in other countries.Carwow has grown steadily since then, thanks to word of mouth and a popular YouTube channel where employees review cars. James says that the videos get 17 million views every month.Last year the company made 55,000 sales via its website, accounting for 5% of private new car sales in the UK. It also now operates in Germany and France.More than 2,000 dealers across the UK pay an undisclosed fee to be listed on the site. James says that they all pay the same amount, whether they are selling luxury cars or budget vehicles. He says this level approach is vital because it means that Carwow is ""completely agnostic about what car people buy"".Meanwhile, total investment in the business has now reached Â£45m. This means that James, who is chief executive, no longer has a majority stake, something he says he is fine with.""You can either take no investment and never grow, or secure it and really gain traction.""Alexandra, 31, who is now James' fiancÃ©e and holds the creative director job title, also has shares in the business, as does David Santoro, 34, who is the chief technical officer.Motoring journalist Robin Roberts says that the likes of Carwow, and its rivals such as Coast2Coast Cars, are a welcome addition to the marketplace because they help to ""relieve the hassle"" of buying a new car.""I don't know anyone who actually enjoys the process of buying a car after the initial thrill of viewing one or test-driving a model,"" he says.""So turning the tables and having dealers competing for your business has to be welcomed.""While James admits that he may one day decide to sell up, he says that is a very long way off.""We feel that we have barely got started at Carwow, we have barely touched the surface. There is huge opportunity to grow the business."""
tech,"A Chinese headmaster has been fired after a secret stack of crypto-currency mining machines was found connected to his school's electricity supply.Teachers at the school in Hunan became suspicious of a whirring noise that continued day and night, local media report.This led to the discovery of the machines, which were mining the crypto-currency Ethereum.They racked up an electricity bill of 14,700 yuan (Â£1,600). The excessive electricity consumption had previously been reported to the headmaster, Lei Hua, but he reportedly dismissed it as being caused by air conditioners and heating devices.Mining crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum involves connecting computers, usually specialised ""mining machines"", to the currency network.By providing computing power for validating transactions on that network, mining-machine owners are rewarded with newly generated coins, making it a potentially lucrative exercise - especially when done at scale.In this case, a total of eight mining machines were installed in the Hunan school's computer room between summer 2017 and summer 2018.The headmaster had originally spent 10,000 yuan on a single machine for use at home, but allegedly decided to move it to the school after he saw how much electricity it consumed.The deputy headmaster also became involved in the scheme and allegedly acquired a ninth machine for himself in January, which was also installed at the school.The computer network in the building became overloaded as a result of the mining activity, according to reports, and this ""interfered"" with teaching.The headmaster was fired in October and his deputy received an official warning.A local authority responsible for ""discipline inspection"" has claimed the money that was made through the mining activities.""The noise and heat of nine actively running mining machines would have been very noticeable,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House.""Sadly, stealing electricity is one way that people have tried to maximize their revenue - by avoiding those costs it can drastically improve returns on a mining operation.""Surreptitious crypto-currency mining has been discovered elsewhere. In February, several scientists at a top-secret Russian nuclear warhead facility were arrested for allegedly mining Bitcoin with the facility's supercomputers."
tech,"Google employees will now be able to more freely speak out over issues of sexual harassment at the firm.Responding to demands from the around 20,000 workers who protested last week, the company has said it will end the practice of ""forced arbitration"" in cases of sexual harassment.Arbitration will now be optional, chief executive Sundar Pichai said in an all-staff email.The company did not, however, respond employees' demands in other major areas of concern, angering campaigners.Most notably, it did not comment on calls for Google's board to have an employee representative, and for the company's chief diversity officer to report directly to the chief executive.In an email to staff on Thursday, Mr Pichai said: ""Over the past few weeks Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared.""We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.""The measures, Mr Pichai said, will increase transparency around instances of sexual harassment, expand mandatory training, and offer increased support for those with claims.Most impactful will be a shift away from forced arbitration, a highly-criticised practice that meant employees were contractually-bound to deal with complaints internally, in what some legal observers have described as being a ""private justice system"".""We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,"" Mr Pichai wrote. ""Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (eg personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you.""But the Tech Workers Coalition, which backed last week's action, said the measures did not go nearly far enough, particularly where it related to contractors who worked with the firm.""Sundar ignored the demand for a worker to be represented on the board and [temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs)] continue to have no adequate protections from sexual harassment, who make up over half the Google workforce and are disproportionately women and people of colour. ""TVCs didn't receive this email this morning, and have been excluded from the townhall. This deliberate sleight demonstrates the caste-like system deployed by Google, which fails to protect its workers and our colleagues."" The spokesperson added: ""For a company that likes to innovate, it's striking to see such a lack of vision for treating all of their workforce with basic dignity. We take inspiration from all who work at Google to keep fighting to build worker power.""Campaigners hope the promised overhaul of how Google handles issues around sexual harassment will remove a culture of secrecy that saw one high-profile engineer leave the company with an $90m pay out, despite ""credible"" claims of inappropriate behaviour.The company later said that over the past two years, 48 other employees - including 13 considered to be senior staff - had been fired over sexual harassment issues.More widely, Google's move to end forced arbitration for sexual harassment claims may energise employees at other firms to demand the same. Uber and Microsoft had already dropped the practice.________Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

tech,"A US man accused of knocking game servers offline in a series of attacks has pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking.Sony, EA Origin and Steam were all hit by Utah resident Austin Thompson's attacks in 2013 and 2014.Mr Thompson also admitted to causing damage costing $95,000 (Â£73,000) as part of his plea agreement.The maximum sentence for the crimes is 10 years in jail and fines of up to $250,000.In the attacks, gamers were prevented from playing as Mr Thompson swamped connections to servers with huge amounts of bogus data - so-called denial of service attacks. Imminent attacks were announced via a Twitter account called ""derptrolling"" which also featured screenshots of error messages caused by the flood of data. Many of the game servers were offline for hours at a time.Tweets sent via the derptrolling account suggested more than one person was behind the attacks, but Mr Thompson is the only person mentioned in a Department of Justice (DoJ) statement.""Denial of service attacks cost businesses millions of dollars annually,"" said US attorney Adam Braverman in the DoJ statement. ""We are committed to finding and prosecuting those who disrupt businesses, often for nothing more than ego.""Mr Thompson is due to be sentenced at a hearing on 1 March, 2019. "
tech,"YouTube has restored several videos showing a women's rights campaigner being killed in a variety of ways in the video game Red Dead Redemption 2.The platform had deleted the recordings on Wednesday and in one case had banned the clip creator involved.The action had represented its first such response to depictions of graphic violence within a mainstream game.But it now says that it made a ""mistake"" and has restricted the clips so they cannot be seen by under-18s.The U-turn occurred after a backlash on social media.This included the vlogger PewDiePie retweeting a complaint by one of the video creators, who had accused YouTube of unfair treatment.Another popular vlogger, Keem, had also drawn attention to the affair claiming it was ""going to create GamerGate 2.0"".Ryan Wyatt, YouTube's head of gaming, eventually responded - blaming the deletions on a misinterpretation of YouTube's community guidelines.""The reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake,"" he tweeted..However, the BBC understands the original decision had involved several members of YouTube's staff and that the original ruling was overturned once the business's wider gaming team took charge. ""YouTube's community guidelines prohibit among other things, gratuitous violence, nudity, dangerous and illegal  activities, and hate speech,"" a spokeswoman said.""Creative formats such as video games can be challenging to assess but when content crosses the line and is flagged to our attention, we take action as necessary.""The Western-themed Red Dead Redemption 2 is set at the end of the 19th Century, about two decades before women were given the vote in all US states.Within the game the player meets several suffragettes.In one case it is possible to assault and kill one of the campaigners.Several YouTube creators took advantage of this to post recordings of the game's protagonist killing the computer-controlled character in a series of gruesome ways.These included the woman being:In linked comments, several users made jokes about the fact it was possible to assault a ""feminist"" in this way.On Wednesday morning, the BBC asked the firm whether 10 such clips breached its policies.YouTube subsequently removed eight of them, leaving two examples in which the suffragette was beaten but not killed.Among those blocked was a clip that had attracted more than 1.5 million clicks within a channel that had attracted more than 473,000 subscribers.The channel's UK-based owner was initially told he was also being banned from owning or setting up other accounts.All of the creator's videos have since been restored, including clips of other characters being attacked within Red Dead Redemption 2.One company-watcher said the incident pointed to a wider problem.""YouTube's guidelines have been accused of being vague and open to interpretation, meaning even when YouTube does act upon them, its decision is often challenged as censorship,"" commented Teoh Lander-Boyce, co-editor of TenEighty magazine.""It can seem to many creators that the guidelines are not enforced even-handedly, often taking either a massive outrage online or interest from mainstream media to get it to take notice.""This disparity between when it does and doesn't act, and how it enforces the rules just points to a lack of clarity and understanding on what the community guidelines really mean.""Another YouTube creator also suggested the matter had been mishandled.""It's interesting that in a huge beautiful game with an amazing array of things to do, that's actually pretty progressive in its storytelling... someone decided to take a character representative of progress for women and kill her in not just one but multiple ways for several videos,"" Outside Xtra presenter Ellen Rose said.""It's also interesting, but not at all surprising, that these are some of that channel's most popular videos for months, and people in the comments are being weirdly gleeful about the idea of a women's rights campaigner  - or 'annoying feminist' - being assaulted this way. ""I think that YouTube needs to stop and look at those responses when making decisions as to whether or not a clip is good for the site.""Red Dead Redemption 2 has attracted very positive reviews, and attained a score of 97 out of 100 on Metacritic, which collates critics' reviews.Many of the 18-certificate game's non-playable characters can be attacked, but there has been criticism of a decision to allow the suffragette to be vulnerable, given the controversy this could attract.Suffragettes also appear in another part of the game, but attacking them there leads to the failure of the mission.The BBC has asked developer Rockstar Games for comment.

tech,"Xiaomi - the world's fourth bestselling handset maker - has added the UK to is growing list of markets.The Chinese firm's initial line-up for the country includes three smartphones, a fitness-tracking wristband and an electric scooter.It is also opening a shop in London's Westfield Shepherd's Bush shopping centre, which also has an Apple store.The launch expands its presence in Western Europe, where it is also active in Spain, France and Italy.Xiaomi has a reputation for competitively pricing its products and seeking to maximise earnings by prioritising volume over profit mark-up.Earlier this year, it announced it would limit its hardware products' net profit margin to 5%, suggesting the move would help convince customers it was a brand that could be trusted.According to market research firm IDC, only Huawei's smartphone sales are outpacing it in terms of growth among the major manufacturers.Source: IDC - based on preliminary dataXiaomi's initial flagship phone for the UK will be the Mi 8 Pro - an Android handset with a fingerprint sensor hidden behind its 6.2in (15.7cm) display, and a transparent glass rear through which some of its components can be seen.It will start at Â£499. That is is significantly less than the cost of premium models sold in the country by Apple, Samsung, HTC, Sony and Huawei, but it matches the price of OnePlus's new 6T.Co-founder Xiang Wang told the BBC that Xiaomi intended to  expand its range of products in the UK in 2019, and might also launch its sub-brand Poco.And while he said his firm has no plans at present to hold one of its famous ""flash sales"" in the country - in which limited quantities of a new device are put on sale at a set time - he indicated that they could be offered at a later date to help drive awareness.""When Xiaomi enters a country they almost always grow very fast,"" commented Neil Mawston, from the consultancy Strategy Analytics.""That's happened in India, Indonesia and Russia and now we're seeing it grow very quickly in Spain.""Those most at risk of losing sales to them in the UK include Samsung, Huawei, TCL Alcatel, LG and ZTE - Apple is probably safe because it plays in much higher price tiers.""Another expert added that it would be a mistake solely to focus on the company's smartphone ambitions.""It's jaw-dropping the amount of products that Xiaomi makes,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy.""When you go to one of its stores in Hong Kong it's incredible - there's everything from robot vacuum cleaners to smart lamps to air purifiers to electric toothbrushes.""But the big question for me is whether this is a market too far given that there is already an unprecedented level of competitive intensity here, particularly among smartphones.""However, a third analyst said the Chinese company may have picked the perfect time to join the fray.""After the UK leaves the European Union, we may see consumers rein back on discretionary spending, resulting in a falling average sales price moving forward,"" said James Smith, from Futuresource Consulting.""Should the consumer wallet be squeezed... we may see increasing demand for mid-range handsets, a market in which Xiaomi has a very strong offering."""
entertainment,"The latest Fantastic Beasts film The Crimes of Grindelwald has earned mixed reviews from critics. It has a number of three-star reviews with suggestions that the plot is ""overburdened"" with details and preparing for future adventures.  There is praise for the ""vibrantly drawn"" characters and Jude Law is highlighted for his performance as young Dumbledore.Many agree JK Rowling's imagination is ""as awe-inspiring as ever.""The second of five planned Fantastic Beasts films by JK Rowling also earns praise for its special effects.Caryn James in the Hollywood Reporter called it a ""vibrant, engaging improvement"" on the first Fantastic Beasts film. ""The sequel has better and at times galvanising special effects, a darker tone and a high-stakes battle between good and evil. ""Best of all, its characters are more vibrantly drawn, and tangled in relationships that range from delightful to lethal.""But she said the film has some ""serious liabilities, the gravest being a misbegotten performance by Johnny Depp as the villain of the title"". Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian gave it three stars out of five and praised ""the architectural detail of JK Rowling's creativity"", calling it ""as awe-inspiring as ever"".""It is just as spectacular as the wonderful opening film, with lovingly realised creatures, witty inventions and sprightly vignettes.""But he said that he ""couldn't help feeling that the narrative pace was a little hampered, and that we are getting bogged down, just a bit, in a lot of new detail.""He singled out Jude Law's performance as young Dumbledore saying he ""shines in a saggy sequel"".Olly Richards in Time Out awarded three out of five stars. He says the film ""has bags of intermittent charm and a warm familiarity. But too often, it feels like a beast that's been overburdened"".Andrew Barker in Variety added that ""real magic is in short supply in this cluttered expansion of the Harry Potter franchise"".""The film throws plenty of plot twists, loud noises, and multihued magical nebulae at us, but rarely is there much tension, or sense of adventure, or any real longing, just the feeling of watching one chess piece after another being moved into position."" Empire Magazine's Ian Freer agreed, saying ""you can't help feel The Crimes Of Grindelwald is still treading water until future chapters"".He gave the film three stars and hoped for more from the Dumbledore and Grindelwald relationship.  ""The vaunted appearance of young Dumbledore, Jude Law bringing tweed and a twinkle to a more mischievous take on the professor. ""The question of Dumbledore's sexuality is coyly suggested rather than heartily expressed - if it's passed you by Dumbledore is gay, you still might be none the wiser.""Robbie Collin in the Daily Telegraph gave just two stars out of five, saying ""the biggest riddle in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is working out what on earth the film is actually about.""But Chris Hunneysett from the Daily Mirror awarded the film five stars. ""I'm far from a hardcore Potter fan and yet I was spellbound throughout,"" he said.""JK Rowling's extraordinary imagination bursts from the screen in a dazzling swirl of magical action and strong emotional moments powered by a wonderful cast working from her terrific script."
entertainment,"The Beatles are celebrating the 50th birthday of their 1968 double album - dubbed The White Album - with a deluxe edition that delves into the record's exhaustive recording sessions. An interview with producer Giles Martin, who oversaw the anniversary project, reveals some of the box set's secrets and surprises.The Beatles' ninth album has confounded, delighted and divided fans ever since its release in 1968. To some, it's their masterpiece: a vibrant explosion of ideas from a band no longer bound by format, genre or style. To others, it's a mess: a quixotic, fractured collection of songs that fails as often as it soars.""You are either hip to it, or you ain't,"" opined Rolling Stone in its original review.Simply called The Beatles, the 30-track double LP became known as The White Album thanks to its plain white, subtly embossed sleeve - and the contrast to the colourful explosion of their previous album, Sgt Pepper, was deliberate. The White Album is turbulent, raw, and challenging - partly in reaction to the political upheaval at the end of the 1960s, as the Vietnam War and the assassination of Martin Luther King crushed the idealism of the Summer Of Love.""Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what the Beatles are on about,"" wrote Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times.Dark forces were present in the studio too, as the band's friendship started to fracture. End of Youtube post  by TheBeatlesVEVO""The White Album was the tension album,"" Paul McCartney said in 1987. ""Never before had we recorded with beds in the studio and people visiting for hours on end, business meetings and all that. There was a lot of friction.""By John Lennon's own account, the band found themselves creatively and personally at loggerheads.""Every track is an individual track,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1970. ""There isn't any Beatle music on it... It was John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.""And yet, the outtakes on a new, six-disc deluxe edition of the White Album explode that myth. Here are The Beatles in George Harrison's house in Esher, Surrey, joking around as they lay down demos for the album; and there are the band jamming a rich, psychedelic version of Helter Skelter that's 14 minutes long.""They're enjoying playing together,"" says Giles Martin, son of Beatles' producer George Martin, who has overseen the reissue.""It's a very collaborative record - and that's the biggest shock for me, because I never thought it was.""Speaking at Abbey Road Studios, Giles shared his insights into the Beatles' longest, most scintillating record.The Beatles spent an extraordinary amount of time in the studio for this album. What was going on?I think it's because they enjoyed playing. They'd stopped touring before Sgt Pepper the year before - and so the studios became the only place they played live. It was like, ""We're at Abbey Road. This is our place. What are we going to come up with today?"" That's why we get so many takes of the songs.What did you learn from investigating the tapes?The biggest thing was I always believed the White Album was an unhappy and fragmented record made by four solo Beatles, all working in different rooms. And it wasn't that. If you listen to the outtakes, it's a hugely collaborative process.End of Youtube post 2 by TheBeatlesVEVOAnd yet George Harrison, Ringo Starr and your dad all walked out of the sessions at some point. What was the source of tension?Sgt Pepper was such a concise and great achievement, and my dad felt it was being derailed. He thought there'd be a progression - more collages of sound, more soundscapes, more conceptual work - but The White Album is very much, ""here's a song, here's another song, here's another song"".  Your dad had just become a father for the first time, too...Yes, my sister was born in 1967 so he had a young daughter at home - but the band were working incredibly long hours. Famously, they had to break into the fridge to get milk for tea because Abbey Road was closed overnight.So for my dad and the engineering team, they were like, ""It's 4:30 in the morning, we're listening to 70 takes of Sexy Sadieâ¦ Should we just go home?""It must be emotional when you hear his voice on these tapes.It is emotional and strange - but I'm used to it. We live down in the countryside and his grave is in the village next door to ours. We visit the grave and that's him. So that's more emotional for me than hearing him on the tapes.What were the challenges in remixing this album?We actually started mixing it last December, and I got to January and said, ""This sounds terrible. It's too clean."" The White Album is slightly trashy. It's visceral, it slaps you in the face. We'd made it sound like Steely Dan or Dire Straits... so we went back and worked out a way to preserve that sound.We live in a world of streaming, where Blackbird could be played next to Ed Sheeran and they [should both] sound as young and fresh as each other.It's crazy to think that, when Paul wrote Blackbird, he was the same age as Ed Sheeran is now.That's the key for me. Paul will always be that age on Blackbird because a recording is a timestamp. So, in 15 years' time, when someone finds Blackbird or finds Castle On The Hill, hopefully they're going to think, ""This is two 27-year-olds"".On one of the outtakes of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, you hear George Harrison asking for a cheese and marmite sandwich. Did you order one from the Abbey Road canteen for the sake of historical accuracy?No, I didn't! It's funny: George mentions Marmite three times on the White Album, like there's some sort of endorsement going on.Those little snatches of studio conversation really bring the album to life.That's the nice thing. You think of While My Guitar Gently Weeps as this other-worldly, super-human thing and George is ordering a cheese and marmite sandwich literally seconds before he starts to sing.We're led to believe in the world of X Factor that anyone can be a singer, and it just isn't true. You have to have a God-given talent and I find that hugely reassuring, spiritually. What's the secret? The secret is human ability. And The Beatles had it in spades....Absolutely. There's 30 songs on the White Album but during this time they also did Across The Universe, Hey Bulldog, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude... They wouldn't stop. And that was the most taxing thing in the studio. To deal with The Beatles and to deal with their demand, their output, was just too hard.Do you think that's why George Harrison felt sidelined? It seems crazy that Not Guilty got vetoed in favour of something like Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.I've heard my dad talk about this and he always said openly that, yes, he didn't give George enough time. And John and Paul probably didn't give George enough time either. They had each other but George was isolated, in a bubble. I think he brought in Eric Clapton for While My Guitar Gently Weeps because it was a really great song; and he knew that if he brought the best guitarist in the world to the session, they would have to listen.If there was one song you could remove from The White Album and replace with an alternate take, or another song entirely, what would it be?It's an impossible question to answer because you can't change history.Wild Honey Pie was definitely one of my least favourite songs on The White Album, but it's a bit like Stockholm Syndrome: When we mixed it, we had to press our fingers into the tape machine to wobble the tape, because the song has that 'wow-ow-wow' fluttering effect; and I kind of become fond of it in a strange way.So you have to replicate effects that don't exist on the original recordings?Always. Absolutely. We can't recreate everything from the tapes. There's certain vocal sounds or the slight distortion you get in Glass Onion and, without them, it sounds a bit boring. Is it true that you got a completely new recording of the flamenco guitar that opens The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill?Well, that's actually played on a Mellotron which, for those who don't know, was the original sampler. I remembered Paul still had the Mellotron, so it was just a question of me phoning him up and getting his engineer to record it in better quality.Now, someone said, ""It's sacrosanct! How could you do that?"" But it's the same machine, playing the same tape. If I can get a better version of it, then we should use it.I always think about my dad and The Beatles being in the room with me when I'm doing this work. If I can make the guitar from Dear Prudence shimmer and sound good using the techniques they used, I think John would be happy.I work with ghosts all the time. If I had a Ouija board, I'd probably use one.The deluxe edition of The Beatles is out now."
entertainment,"For Remembrance Sunday BBC Two is screening Peter Jackson's World War one documentary They Shall Not Grow Old - an extraordinary reworking of newsreel archive from the western front, much of it colourised to show soldiers as though filmed only yesterday. But a century ago how did the early newsreels cover life and death in the trenches?  And were they showing the real thing?Only the keenest silent film buffs know much about cameramen Geoffrey Malins and J B McDowell. But hundreds of millions of us know their work on screen - and many more are seeing it now thanks to They Shall Not Grow Old.Virtually all British footage from World War I trenches and battlefields was filmed for the government-controlled organisation British Topical. Malins and McDowell shot the great majority of it and their work has featured in countless documentaries in the decades since.  Dr Lawrence Napper has studied the way newsreel coverage changed during the war.  ""War broke out in July 1914 but it wasn't until almost the end of 1915 that British news cameramen were allowed to France,"" he says. ""Partly it was that film had been seen as entertainment for the working class - no-one in Whitehall knew what to make of endless requests from companies like Pathe for access to the trenches. Newsreels were a pretty new medium and pre-war they'd dealt only with soft stories - the Boat Race or a royal visit somewhere.""The big turning point came with a documentary called The Battle of the Somme, which lasts around 70 minutes.  It used Malins' and McDowell's material and it was a massive hit. ""It's been claimed a greater proportion of the British population saw it than any other film ever,"" Napper says. ""There was a real hunger to see how the war was going.""Stephen Badsey of the University of Wolverhampton has been studying World War I footage for much of his career.  ""One of the reasons newsreel cameraman were finally allowed out to France was because it became clear Britain could no longer rely on a volunteer army. Conscription was coming and the government needed Britons to see what was being done in their name.""Badsey says there are around 1,000 different items of film, ranging from very short clips to complete stories. ""Inevitably there are some sequences which get used again and again - quite a lot of Peter Jackson's film comes from The Battle of the Somme.  ""There's some extraordinary material in the original documentary which impresses even now. You could say it's the first combat documentary ever shot.""But public taste changed quickly.  By the summer of 1917 Britain was getting a bit bored with documentaries and the War Office in effect bought out the Topical Budget company and issued short twice-weekly newsreels. The Whitehall propaganda machine was in control.""Ignoring political machinations at home, Malins and McDowell had continued to operate as best they could on the Western Front. They were using big hand-cranked Moy and Bastie cine-cameras which were normally secured to a heavy tripod and couldn't be moved easily.All of which raises the question - how much of what we see of British Topical's work (which means most of what we ever see from the trenches) is genuine? And how much of the action was staged and a century later needs to be treated with care?Napper thinks the answer is complex.""In Peter Jackson's film there's a poignant scene of men waiting to go into battle, which is taken from The Battle of the Somme. We know it's the real thing, partly because we know exactly where Geoffrey Malins filmed and when.  ""And we're very familiar with scenes of artillery shooting towards the German lines - but that would be a long way from any real Germans because that's how artillery works. So usually you'd assume those sequences are real. But people sometimes think they've seen big battle sequences close up, which in reality barely exist.  ""Non-staged material of things exploding was almost always shot low-down with Malins poking his camera briefly above the top of the trench.  Any explosions would in reality have been in the distance.""Reviews have mentioned Peter Jackson's achievement in colourising the material.  What has been spotted less is that he's scanned and digitally zoomed in so certain explosions seem far closer than they really were: they look as though they were shot on modern Steadicam.  They're real explosions but originally they were smaller in frame and across no man's land.""Napper says the work of Malins and McDowell remained influential even after the war. ""In the 1920s you get reconstructions of battles but filmed in peacetime. People were trying to recreate what the two men might have filmed if they could have done so without getting shot.""One thing about their work which is genuine often surprises people - the inclusion of dead bodies. Napper says it was controversial even at the time.""When the Somme film was shown in 1916 the Dean of Durham was among those who protested at the depiction of death.  But there were others who wanted to see the reality of war.""  It's a debate that goes on a century later.   They Shall Not Grow Old is on BBC Two on Sunday 11 November at 21.30 GMT."
entertainment,"Bassist Peter Hook is to auction a collection of guitars and memorabilia from his Joy Division and New Order days after falling out with his former bandmates.The items up for sale include his first bass and the guitar he used on Joy Division's second album, Closer.It comes a year after a legal action with the rest of the band was settled.""The court cases with the others didn't help me viewing either band in a very rosy light,"" Hook told the BBC.Hook fell out with the other group members in 2007 and began playing Joy Division material with his own band, The Light, in 2010.He told BBC News he had come to feel ""something had to go"" and that the memories associated with the Joy Division and New Order items had become tarnished.""Since starting again in 2010 and playing the music, which is the only thing I'm allowed to do, I came to realise that the people who allowed me to play the music - i.e. the fans - were the only ones that mattered,"" he said.""I felt something had been broken and I thought, 'is it time to let [the items] fly?' It felt like the right time. Maybe not for the right reason, I have to say.""The memorabilia up for sale includes the Gibson EB-0 replica he bought the day after watching the Sex Pistols' legendary 1976 gig at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, a concert that is credited with inspiring a generation of musicians.""I borrowed the money off my mother,"" Hook recalled. ""Bernard [Sumner] had told me, 'Make sure you get a bass guitar because I've got a guitar.' I didn't know the difference.""I didn't have any more money to buy a case so [the shop owner] stuffed it in two black bin liners and I very proudly sat on the bus with my bass guitar in its two black bin liners. It was punk from start to finish.""When I got home my father laughed at me and said, 'What are you going to do with that?' At that precise moment I did not have a clue.""I just knew I wanted to run off and join the circus, and Johnny Rotten had shown me the way.""Hook played that bass on Joy Division's debut EP, An Ideal for Living, and used it to write for the band's first album, Unknown Pleasures.It will go up for sale with a Â£4,000 valuation at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, on 2 March.A portion of the auction's proceeds will go to mental health charity Calm and The Epilepsy Society, in remembrance of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, who was epileptic.Curtis took his own life shortly before the band were due to set off on a US tour in 1980.Other lots on sale include the itineraries for that tour and a Shergold Marathon custom six-string bass.Hook, 62, used the instrument on Joy Division's second album and after New Order formed following Curtis's death.Curtis's typed and signed lyrics for the song Failures, which appeared on An Ideal for Living, will be offered, as will a leather jacket Hook bought in 1977 and wore into the late 1980s.He is also selling Factory Records' famous floating boardroom table.""I'm just hoping these things will go out into the world and be appreciated for the massive part they played in history,"" said Hook."
entertainment,"Billie Marten doesn't seem to wear her cloak of youth lightly.""I'm 19 years old - it's the worst thing about me,"" she says when asked her age.Expanding on this, she says: ""I guess it's just the reaction when you say you haven't even hit your 20s yet.""Most people's perceptions of you immediately change because they know you've not been on this planet very long. There's a tendency to say, 'Oh, she's just a girl and she doesn't know what she's doing.'""On the contrary for this teenager, who released her first EP having just turned 15, with her first album following two years later.She's now releasing more material - with a second album on the way - full of the lessons a life of touring, couch-surfing in London, and working in a charity shop has taught her.""The first album was more about how endearing and how exciting everything was and how I just LOVE London,"" recalls Marten, who hails from near Ripon in North Yorkshire.""This one is a bit more frank, the songs are a lot simpler. It's more of an insular album,"" says the songwriter.End of Youtube post  by BillieMartenVEVOThis perhaps reflects what she describes as the ""disruptive"" experience of staying in other people's houses - on spare beds and sofas - and never having a place of her own. ""Like a stray puppy,"" she adds.""I hate being a bag lady - and I'm always that person. Carrying guitars and carrying bags. And it makes me quite anxious.""So just to have one key and one bed to come to has been really good for me,"" she says, having recently rented her own place in east London.It's significant, however, that when asked where she is happiest she says: ""Home."" And then clarifies that she means with her parents in Yorkshire.The singer admits she suffers from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) - a type of depression that is often linked to shorter autumn and winter days. And says she is more affected by the condition living in the city.""I hate when the snow goes black - that's a really horrible thing for me. I hate it. Winter in the city is so much worse for me. Winter in the countryside is slightly better.  ""In the city everybody's still grafting and working, heads down, and there's no communal love,"" she says. ""When I go home we're all miserable but we're all in it together, whereas here you're left on your own a lot. The Tube sucks and it's always dark.  It's harder.""Her latest release, Blue Sea Red Sea, was written by Marten on a wintry day, after having just moved to London. The song, in Marten's signature lyrical, folksy style, sounds like someone trying to convince themselves - and everyone else - that they are perfectly fine, thank you very much: ""I'm a fish in a blue sea, and I like it/I don't, don't need you to love me,"" run the lyrics - set to an upbeat tempo.But later lines -""This snow is falling heavy/Wish my mother would come and get me"" - somewhat give away the lie.""I was working in this pub and was completely miserable,"" the singer remembers. ""So I decided to sit and write the happiest, simplest pop song I could.""Marten says music isn't always key to getting herself out of a dip though: ""I will turn to baking or something quite homely and sentimental for me. Or walking is a huge help. I'll just walk for two to three hours and get lost.""Your attitude to everything changes - to other people. You get very bitter, very resentful of people's lives if they're not affected by it - which isn't a nice trait to have.  ""Most mental illnesses do that. They isolate you - rather than make you want to accept other people's love or your own love.""So rather than turn inwards, Marten has turned outwards. Few teenagers - and even fewer artists in the music industry volunteer once a week at a charity shop.""I quit the pub because that was just ruining my life,"" she says. ""And that day I walked past Crisis in Finsbury Park. They've got a really good charity shop there and there was just this little sign in the window that said, 'We really need volunteers'.""The singer says the volunteer work there is ""fulfilling"" and it's clear she is inspired by what she finds at the shop - but also that she uses it as a therapy of sorts.""I like the idea of walking into this communal haven. There's just this huge ethos of hard work and giving. ""Most of the volunteers have such busy lives. Some of the volunteers have three or four kids and they have to sort childcare just so they can do this for four hours a day. There isn't a bad soul in that building - it's brilliant.""Perhaps it's some of these experiences that have helped Marten come to terms with her youth.""My youth?"" she asks. ""It's fading,"" she says with a laugh. ""I do feel a lot more tired than I should, that's for sure.""I'm slowly learning to care less. I envy a lot of people who have no self-doubt or don't analyse anything.""But my motto is: Nobody's looking at you,"" she says echoing the lyrics of her previous single, Bird. ""When I did my first gigs, my dad used to say that to me and said if no-one shows up, it's fine. ""It's a general sense of just do your thing. I say it to myself all the time: Nobody's looking at you and don't think too much about it.""It works, I promise."
politics,"Any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU must not ""trap"" the UK in a customs arrangement it cannot choose to leave, Andrea Leadsom has told the BBC.The Brexiteer minister urged Tories to back the PM and said she was ""sticking in government"" to work for a good deal.But the UK must not be ""held against its will"" in any ""backstop"" aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border, she said.On Friday, pro-Remain minister Jo Johnson quit the government and called for a new referendum on the final deal.Asked if other ministers might resign, Commons leader Mrs Leadsom told BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics she was not expecting any, adding: ""I do urge colleagues to support the prime minister.""We are at a very difficult stage. What we have to do is hold our nerve and keep negotiating, make sure that we are pointing out to our EU friends and neighbours that it's in all of our interests to get a good deal.""The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the bloc next March.While it says a deal is 95% agreed, they have been unable to agree on a legally binding mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Earlier shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including another referendum, if a Brexit deal was voted down in the Commons. Mrs Leadsom, who Theresa May beat to the Conservative leadership in 2016, said there would not be another referendum if MPs rejected the final withdrawal deal. But she said she believed ""most members of Parliament would vote for a deal rather than no deal"".If sufficient progress is made on the ""backstop"" it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.One option is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement - while the EU says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.By BBC political correspondent Jessica ParkerMPs on all sides are readily setting out their conditions and caveats when it comes to a potential Brexit deal.And while Andrea Leadsom made it clear that she still supports Prime Minister Theresa May, there was a hint too that she has her own red lines, saying that the UK must not end up trapped in an EU customs arrangement. This plays into wider fears in some Conservative quarters that Mrs May could end up accepting a compromise too far on the ""backstop"" issue, in order to get a withdrawal agreement with the EU over the line.  Mrs Leadsom said while the backstop was not a ""likely scenario"" - because she believed a trade deal could be reached before it would be necessary - it must be ""time limited"" and ""include the entire UK"", rather than just Northern Ireland. And the UK must be able to decide to leave it - without the EU overturning that decision.She added: ""The UK cannot be forced to remain in a customs arrangement. Now how that specifically works is exactly what is being discussed and negotiated on now. The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement.""Earlier Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""If you have too hard a line about saying, 'Well we must just have a totally unilateral exit, or there's an absolutely fixed, hard end date,' that is... very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side.""On the other hand, people here rightly want comfort and they should be able to have comfort and confidence that it isn't an open-ended thing.""Meanwhile, General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show what the military might be called on to do, in the event the UK leaves the EU with no withdrawal deal in place, saying ""we stand ready to help in any way we can"".Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News the government had to plan for every scenario adding: ""There are contingency plans being made, there are discussions being held behind the scenes as to what support our armed forces will do.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states. "
politics,"Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry has told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including a new referendum, if MPs vote down a Brexit deal.She was asked about party leader Jeremy Corbyn's comment to a German newspaper that Brexit cannot be stopped.Labour would prefer a general election, she said, but could campaign for ""a People's Vote"" if it were not possible. Tory cabinet minister Damian Hinds said MPs must ""consider the alternatives"" if they vote down the deal.The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's exit from the bloc next March. While the UK government says it is 95% agreed - they have been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time.On Friday, transport minister Jo Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU, quit the government saying he could not support the deal and called for another referendum.Meanwhile Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP - whose party's support Theresa May relies on for key Commons votes - have written a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph warning they are prepared to vote down any deal over proposals to manage the Irish border issue.On Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was quoted in Der Spiegel, having been asked if he would stop Brexit, as saying: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Asked if Brexit could be stopped on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the results of the referendum should be ""abided by"" but there had to be an ""injection of democracy"" in between that result and going any further. That should be a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament, she said. But she said Theresa May was only offering a choice between the UK ""falling off a cliff"" - with no deal agreed - or ""get on this bridge to nowhere"", by backing her deal. She said Labour would refuse to ""play that sort of game"" and, if the vote was lost, the party wanted a general election.She added: ""If we don't have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a People's Vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there."" The People's Vote campaign group organised the march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people. The group wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. Ms Thornberry said Mr Corbyn's comments had to be seen in context and he was explaining that: ""We had a referendum, that we are democrats over and above everything else."" At the Labour Party conference in September, party members approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote.Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Sunday Times: ""There is no duty on MPs to surrender to a bad deal."" Instead, he said that MPs would be able to table motions, press amendments and trigger a no-confidence vote in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal at all.Sir Keir said: ""I remain as convinced as ever that the consequences of no deal would be so severe that it cannot be allowed to happen.""But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC that people would have to consider a deal as a whole, stating: ""They need to think about what the alternatives are as well.""It is no good just not liking individual aspects. If you're going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative.""I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying 'yeah, let's get on with it'.""He added: ""It is not necessarily going to be something everybody is going to think is absolutely perfectly what they want.""But that's the nature of these things, there are some trade-offs."" "
politics,"DUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock.The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster, leaked to the Times.Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides.Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"".The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that.Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"".""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader.""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.       Mrs Foster added: ""I believe that not only would we not be able to support what she has sent to us but that there are many others that wouldn't be able to support it in her own party as well.""If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.""The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"".The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date.The BBC's John Campbell said what was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs.He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"".The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead.""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."""
politics,"Jo Johnson has quit as transport minister and called for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit.The MP, who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum, said the  deal being negotiated with the EU ""will be a terrible mistake"".Arguing Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, he said what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"".Downing Street thanked him for his work but ruled out another referendum.Jo Johnson voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum while his brother Boris, who quit as foreign secretary in July, was a leading Brexiteer.His brother praised his decision, saying they were ""united in dismay"" at the PM's handling of the negotiations. Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, said they cannot support any deal which included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK.Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Kent, said the choice being finalised was either:He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister.But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public.""The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued.Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergFor some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit.A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead.He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact.Read Laura's full blogHe added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union.""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act.""In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb.For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"".But asked in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel whether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit.""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans.""Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal.And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum.Huge respect for @JoJohnsonUK . Itâs tough resigning from a Ministerial post, heâs done the right thing. Now is the time for people to stand up for what they believe in or we will sleepwalk to a #Brexit disaster. There is another way â itâs a @peoplesvote_ukEnd of Twitter post  by @Anna_SoubryDavid Davis, who quit as Brexit Secretary over Mrs May's Chequers Brexit plan, tweeted: Sorry to see @JoJohnsonUK resign. He's right that the Government's current proposals are ""a travesty of Brexit"" and represent a huge democratic deficit - out of Europe but run by Europe. However, a 2nd referendum is not the way forward and is not supported by the public.End of Twitter post  by @DavidDavisMP"
politics,"A cabinet minister has spoken about how he likes to unwind by spending time with his ""very large"" Lego collection.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told Talk Radio he found assembling the building bricks ""therapeutic"".""I think everybody who does any difficult or stressful job needs a way to switch off,"" he said. ""We all have different ways, mine is Lego.""The Conservative MP also said claims that he did not read any newspapers were ""complete nonsense"".Mr Wright, whose department is conducting a review of the future economic viability of the press, raised eyebrows last month when he told a media conference he did not subscribe to any newspapers or magazines.He told Talk Radio that he had given a straight answer to a straight question when he was asked if he had read a newspaper on the morning of the Society of Editors event in Salford.""The answer I gave was I didn't read a newspaper that morning which was true,"" he said. ""To suggest that I don't read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do.""What politicians do in their spare time is a subject of enduring interest and occasionally political significance. For some, it is watching their local football team - if they can remember which one they support - or going to the opera. For the prime minister, it is famously walking in the Welsh, or Swiss or Italian hills. The former attorney general, and father-of-two, has a more unusual hinterland for a 46-year old but one which most parents will be able to identify with. ""In my view it is a great way of putting your brain into neutral, which sometimes we all need to do,"" he says of the building bricks. And just how big is his collection? ""It is very large indeed, my wife would say far too large but I find Lego therapeutic."""
sport,"Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said Manchester City's preparations for their derby victory were helped by playing in two ""friendly"" matches during the past week.City returned to the top of the Premier League as goals from David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Ilkay Gundogan earned the champions three points at Etihad Stadium.But Mourinho said the hosts had an advantage as their past two games - home thrashings of Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk in which they won by an aggregate 12-1 - were significantly more straightforward than his team's most recent matches.This was United's third away game in succession, following back-to-back wins at Bournemouth last weekend and Juventus on Wednesday.""It's a heavy result for the effort of a team that had three away matches in the same week, with a super difficult match of a high, demanding level in Juventus against a team that had two friendly matches at home against Southampton and Shakhtar,"" Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 live.""The physical fatigue and the mental fatigue leads to mistakes. They were tired physically and mentally. You need to be in football or another high-level sport to know what that is. The concentration of the big matches, they dry you. You are dry inside. To be ready again for another big match is not easy.""City's victory was rarely in doubt after Silva bundled home an early goal to give them a narrow interval advantage.They got the second their superiority deserved with Aguero's rasping, rising finish past David de Gea three minutes into the second half following an exchange of passes with Riyad Mahrez.Mourinho's side, without injured Paul Pogba, barely mounted a serious threat but were given hope of earning an unlikely point just before the hour when Romelu Lukaku was hauled down by Ederson seconds after he had come on as substitute. Anthony Martial sent the Brazilian the wrong way from the spot.It briefly revived memories of last season's dramatic derby here when United came from two goals down to win, but City never looked like losing control and wrapped up the win two minutes from time when substitute Gundogan took advantage of static United defending to beat De Gea from close range following a 44-pass move.""We deserved the victory,"" City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport. ""The first half we played a little bit with fear and we didn't want to lose the ball. We didn't want to attack and they defended well.""In the second half the game was a bit open so we had to find more space and we made a good performance against a top, top team.""Manchester City's answer to Liverpool briefly returning to the head of the Premier League table earlier in the day was emphatic because this win was as comfortable as the scoreline suggests, arguably even more so.Liverpool and Chelsea remain unbeaten in the Premier League, Jurgen Klopp's side beating Fulham 2-0 and Maurizio Sarri's side slipping as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton at Stamford Bridge.They remain very much in the title shake-up, as do fourth-placed Tottenham.The problem for the chasing pack appears to be that Manchester City are operating on a different level to everyone else.United were probably feeling pleased with themselves that somehow, despite barely laying a glove on City, they were actually still in contention for a point until Gundogan's late goal ended all the arguments.And it was a goal that summed up City under Guardiola.The finish looked simple enough as Gundogan slipped in past some static United defenders to score with ease but it crowned a 44-pass sequence, the most before a goal since Juan Mata scored for Manchester United against Southampton in September 2015.City are two points clear of Liverpool but have a goal difference of +31 as opposed to +18 and this was another of their most difficult fixtures negotiated with their usual flair.Manchester City's latest win was built on the foundations of three established members of their recent glories.Aguero may have gone from brunette to striking blonde but under the new hairstyle remained the same lethal striker who has been the centrepiece of so many of their successes.It was classic Aguero when he scored City's crucial second three minutes after the break, exchanging passes with Mahrez before lashing home a near-post finish that carried so much power, De Gea barely had time to react.It was his 151st goal in 218 Premier League games and his 208th goal in 307 games in all competitions for City. These statistics emphasise his status as one of the modern game's great strikers.David Silva, at 32 now an elder statesman at City, set them on their way with the early opener and showed his usual knack of finding space in crowded areas and ability to dictate tempo even at the most frenetic times.At the heart of it all was the unsung Fernandinho, the 33-year-old Brazilian patrolling midfield with class and quality, working effectively in the shadows.Guardiola knows his worth - and will also know he will be very difficult to replace when the time comes.Mourinho has bemoaned his team's slow starts this season and appears at a loss to discover the cure. And it is now too late to salvage any title aspirations.They had survived a couple of narrow escapes before Silva scored after 12 minutes to put them on the back foot once more and to give City the sort of control and impetus they relish.United clearly missed the injured Pogba, who helped turn this derby around last season, but this was still a performance lacking in invention and serious attacking threat.And while Gundogan's goal crowned a glorious move, Mourinho will have looked on in anguish as United defenders stood around like statues.United are now 12 points adrift of City. They can forget the Premier League title for another season.Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to Match of the Day: ""We wanted to play good in front of our fans and we know how important it is to play in this game. We did well [in the second half] and that goal from Sergio Aguero helped us a lot after half-time.""Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho to Sky Sports: ""We were in the game until the 80th-something minute and the third goal killed the spirit and morale of the team.""One thinking is a bad performance and one thinking is a performance with mistakes. I think ours was a performance with mistakes. ""We are outside the top four, how can we speak about the title? Let's fight to close the gap to jump into the top four. If we jump into the top four then let's see the difference.""Manchester City travel to West Ham on Saturday, 24 November (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League, while Manchester United host Crystal Palace on the same day (also 15:00).Match ends, Manchester City 3, Manchester United 1.Second Half ends, Manchester City 3, Manchester United 1.Corner,  Manchester City.

sport,"Roger Federer paid for his errors as he lost to Japan's Kei Nishikori in his opening group match at the ATP Finals.The Swiss, chasing a 100th career title at the season-ending event, lost 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the world number nine.The normally unflappable Federer showed uncharacteristic frustration, while a calm Nishikori sealed victory when the Swiss hit a wild forehand.    World number one Novak Djokovic opens his campaign against John Isner at the O2 Arena in London on Monday.Federer hit 34 unforced errors - and was given a warning by the umpire for swiping a ball into the stands in the first set - in a performance that he will be keen to forget. The 37-year-old will be back in action on Tuesday when he faces Dominic Thiem, who lost to Kevin Anderson earlier on Sunday.It is the fourth time Federer has lost his opening match at the event, but he can take some comfort from the fact that in 2007 he still went on to win the title.Federer began the match calmly and he put pressure on the Nishikori serve in the fourth game, taking him to deuce. But as his errors began to mount, his mood visibly soured.Nishikori looked like he would run away with the tie-break, forging a 6-1 lead before Federer clawed it back to 6-4, but the Swiss then sent a forehand into the net to hand the set to the Japanese player. The 20-time Grand Slam champion grew increasingly frustrated with himself, while Nishikori simply grew in confidence.Having traded early breaks in the second, the Japanese player broke in the sixth game to go 4-2 up and then served to love in the following game. More Federer errors gave Nishikori three match points and one final mis-hit forehand way beyond the baseline handed him victory. ""I'm glad to win, it is never easy to play with my idol, it is always a big challenge against him, so it was great to win,"" said Nishikori, who has reached the semi-finals here twice.Federer pointed to a combination of nerves and the surface for his below-par showing, which followed a good run of results where he had won the title in Basel and reached the semi-finals in Shanghai and Paris.""The court here plays differently, definitely slower than the last few tournaments I've played. So everyone is making minor adjustments, including me,"" he said. ""I've been feeling fine, just practice was a bit all over the place, practising at Queen's, practising on outside courts here and at Centre [at Wimbledon] as well, so it was not always the same conditions.""Overall I'm hitting the ball alright, the warm-up was fine.""Maybe both of us had a bit of nerves too, not knowing how to attack second serves, trying to get the right feel for it. We both struggled to get that early.""Federer is chasing a record-extending seventh title at the tournament, having last won the title in 2011.His chances had been improved by the withdrawal through injury of world number two Rafael Nadal and number four Juan Martin del Potro, but the favourite for the title before a ball had even been hit was Djokovic. And as if to hammer the point home, the Serb appeared at the O2 Arena on Sunday afternoon to collect his trophy for sealing the year-end world number one ranking sporting a golden number one on his white top.Former British number one Tim Henman on BBC TVThe way Federer has played throughout his whole career, he has made it look ridiculously easy. This was not easy and it's a shock for people to see.I said before the match, for Nishikori to win, Federer had to play way below par and that's what happened.Federer never found his rhythm from the back of the court. Nishikori is not a great server, but Federer didn't make a break point in the first set.Time and time again we saw errors from the back of the court and not getting his feet into the right areas.BBC tennis correspondent Russell FullerFederer had won his last 11 round-robin matches at the ATP Finals, but produced an erratic performance which hugely complicates his passage to the semi-finals. After Nishikori recovered from 5-6 0-30 down with the help of an extraordinarily athletic backhand half volley to win the first set on a tie-break 7-4, he was the stronger and more confident player. Serving and volleying at opportune moments, Nishikori ended a run of six consecutive defeats against Federer."
sport,"Lewis Hamilton took a lucky win in the Brazilian Grand Prix after Red Bull's Max Verstappen lost the lead in a collision with backmarker Esteban Ocon.Verstappen was on course for a superb win when Force India's Ocon left his car on the inside of the Red Bull at the Senna S and pitched it into a spin.The incident dropped the Dutchman back to second place and although he came back at Hamilton, he could not quite catch him.Verstappen remonstrated with Ocon in the driver weighing area afterwards and pushed the Frenchman three times as he expressed his anger at what had happened. Both drivers were called to see the race stewards to explain the incident, with Verstappen ordered to carry out ""two days of public service"" to atone for ""making deliberate physical contact with"" Ocon.The punishment has echoes of that served by Sebastian Vettel after his collision with Hamilton at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Vettel ended up taking part in educational activities organised by the FIA, Formula 1's governing body.Hamilton's win helped Mercedes secure the constructors' championship.They never looked like losing that as Ferrari's challenge faded but the race win was another matter.Verstappen had driven superbly from the start, and was quickly up into second place by lap 10 after passing both Ferraris and then Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes in succession, holding Hamilton's advantage at about 1.7 seconds.Hamilton made an early stop for tyres on lap 19, switching on to mediums with the aim of going to the end, but Verstappen stayed out until lap 35.His pace was so impressive on used super-softs that he almost did enough to rejoin without losing the lead.In the end, he came back out 2.5secs behind Hamilton, and was on his tail within two laps and passed the Briton on lap 39.He looked on course for victory until lap 44, when Ocon, who had not long ago pitted for fresh tyres, caught the Red Bull and was trying to unlap himself.Ocon went around the outside of Verstappen into Turn One and that meant he was on the inside for the right-hander of Turn Two that follows immediately.Verstappen's right rear caught Ocon's left front as he turned into the corner, pitching into a spin and into the run-off area.The Dutchman was furious. ""What an idiot,"" he fumed over the radio.Ocon claimed Verstappen had not left him enough space, but he was handed a 10-second stop-go penalty, the most severe punishment before a disqualification.""I came out of the box, the first lap I stayed behind, the second lap the team said you can unlap yourself if you want,"" Ocon said.""I was side by side and I couldn't disappear and then I saw he turned and we collided but what I am really surprised about is his behaviour after the race. We went on the scales he started to push me and wanted to punch me and stuff and this is not proper.""Verstappen was 5.7secs behind Hamilton when he got going again and he soon began to inch back towards the leader.The car was damaged and Red Bull told him that he had lost some downforce around the front of the side-pod area but he kept coming at Hamilton regardless.Meanwhile, Hamilton was battling problems with his power-unit, which was having drop-outs, as well as worn tyres, Mercedes asking 52 laps of his set of mediums, about their maximum limit.Verstappen closed but he did not have enough time and crossed the line 1.5secs behind.His engineer said: ""I don't know what to say, mate."" And the Dutchman turned the air blue over the radio, saying: ""I know what to say. I hope I don't find him in the paddock."" In the green room before the podium ceremony, Hamilton told Verstappen that Ocon had the right to unlap himself. Verstappen agreed, but added: ""But you can't crash."" Hamilton responded: ""You had more to lose than he did. He had nothing to lose.""Later, Verstappen told the media: ""He has the right to unlap himself but still you have to be careful. He has always been an idiot.""In his post-race interview, he said: ""You do everything right and then you get taken out when he is being lapped.""The car was working great but I don't know what to say. I'm happy with second but we should have won.""Mercedes believed Hamiton's engine was a lap from failing mid-race because of an overheating exhaust but they managed to bring the temperatures down and make it last to the end.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen finished third, the red cars unable to challenge for the lead despite what had been perceived as an advantageous strategy.Raikkonen tracked Bottas in the first stint as the Mercedes hit tyre problems but was unable to pass before Bottas stopped on lap 18.A longer first stint gave Raikkonen a tyre advantage in the second stint, he caught team-mate Vettel, who was ordered to let him past, but again Raikkonen became stuck behind Bottas.Eventually, after 10 laps, Raikkonen finally got past, and then Bottas came under pressure from Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo before Mercedes ordered him in for a second stop on lap 59, with 12 to go.Ricciardo took fourth, ahead of Bottas, with Vettel, who also made a second stop, a struggling sixth.The curtain comes down on the season in Abu Dhabi in two weeks' time. After wins for three different drivers from three different teams in the past three races, who knows what will happen?"
sport,"New Zealand ran in six tries to beat England 34-0 in Leeds in the third and final Test of a series already won by the hosts.Winger Ken Maumalo scored an early try, while Isaac Liu and Kodi Nikorima tries gave the Kiwis an 18-0 half-time lead.England had two first-half tries ruled out after video reviews.Maumalo touched down in the corner before Jesse Bromwich and Joseph Tapine scored under the posts in the final 10 minutes to complete the rout.New Zealand came flying out of the blocks at Elland Road as they looked to deny England a 3-0 series whitewash.Maumalo's early try handed the visitors the lead but England were denied parity when Tommy Makinson, who scored a hat-trick in last week's series-sealing win, had a try disallowed.His diving finish into the corner was ruled out after a review because Tom Burgess was judged to have obstructed the New Zealand defence in the build-up.The decision was met by groans from the home fans, and former Great Britain international Jonathan Davies, speaking on BBC commentary, said he ""would have given the try"" and that it was down to an ""individual's interpretation"".Oliver Gildart was also denied a try by the television match official after Jermaine McGillvary's initial kick through was deemed to have struck a Kiwi player's knee before the England winger connected with the ball.Had one of those tries been awarded, England would have had the chance to draw level with momentum behind them, but instead Liu added a second try for the visitors who never looked back.Man of the match Nikorima had a decisive hand in four of New Zealand's six tries.  The 24-year-old produced the final pass for Liu's and Bromwich's tries, as well as scoring himself and kicking the ball behind the England defence for Maumalo to catch and claim his second try.Nikorima's try came just before the interval when he glided past England prop Chris Hill before trading passes with Shaun Johnson and dotting down under the posts. Johnson has had a quiet series by his high standards, but he saved his best display for Leeds.The New Zealand talisman played a big role in the opening try as his clever break gained valuable yards before the ball was recycled and Maumalo crossed in the corner.The Kiwis had learned the lessons of the previous two defeats and their two star men came to the fore as they enjoyed their biggest win over England for 18 years.  England head coach Wayne Bennett: ""We were just outplayed, and weren't as good as we have been. New Zealand were on their game and deserve the win. We had our moments, if we could have taken one of those tries it could have been different.""We have to learn from it and accept the fact they were too good.""I'm not happy with the performance but I accept what happened. You never want to see that kind of score but it happens.""We've got to keep it in perspective, we've won two great games, won the series and played great football.""New Zealand head coach Michael Maguire: ""It was one we needed. The boys have really put the effort in over the last six weeks and worked hard for a result like that. This group has really grown.""We did the things we said we were going to do. I was really pleased the boys came together and put a lot of pressure on England.""I have got a really big belief in this group. I think we have got something special, some real passionate young men.""England captain James Graham: ""Getting to captain your country in these circumstances wasn't that great but I'm proud of the lads.""There's not a lot of experience in the team but everyone has taken it on and carried the flag forwards.""Former New Zealand international Robbie Hunter-Paul: ""Shaun Johnson was more of the general, moving things around, while Kodi Nikorima had the X-Factor - he's really come of age in this tournament."""

Karim Benzema put Madrid ahead with an expert finish from Luka Modric's pass.After the break Benzema's shot hit the post and went in off defender Gustavo Cabral to put Real 2-0 up but Celta's Hugo Mallo scored with a smart volley.Sergio Ramos chipped in a penalty and Dani Ceballos smashed home in stoppage time after Cabral was sent off, with Brais Mendez adding a late consolation.It was Madrid's fourth straight win under caretaker manager Santiago Solari, who was put in charge after Julen Lopetegui was sacked the day after a 5-1 defeat at Barcelona on 28 October.Champions Barca had earlier on Sunday lost 4-3 at home to an impressive Real Betis side, and this Madrid victory brings the European champions back into the Spanish title race.La Liga rules say temporary managers can only be in place for 14 days, and it is expected Argentine former Madrid winger Solari, 42, will be made permanent manager on Monday.Madrid are sixth in the table, three points off the top four, while Celta are now 14th, four points above the relegation zone.Match ends, Celta de Vigo 2, Real Madrid 4.Second Half ends, Celta de Vigo 2, Real Madrid 4.Goal!
